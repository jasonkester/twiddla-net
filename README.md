Twiddla API .NET Client Library
=========

This is a simple C# wrapper for the [Twiddla API].  It supports every [basic] and [advanced] API call.

Usage
-----

There's a sample project included that provides examples for every type of call you'll need to create, list and modify Twiddla Sessions, Users, etc.

Worth noting: the library itself (that is, the files under the TwiddlaAPI folder) compiles under .NET 2.0 and above, so if you're working off an older version of .NET you can pluck that bit out and drop it straight into your project.

Documentation
-------

Information on how to use the various Twiddla API calls, as well as information about the IFRAME tags you'll need to actually embed Whiteboards into your site can be found in Twiddla's [API Reference]
